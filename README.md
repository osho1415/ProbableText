This project is based on the nifty assignment, as proposed by Joe Zachary (http://nifty.stanford.edu/2003/randomwriter/). 
This version revamps the original algorithm by improving the time complexity from linear O(n) to constant O(1). This is achieved by implementing
a self-written HashMap class in Java.
